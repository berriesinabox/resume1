    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><i>I'm Shivangi Shekhar, a first-year Electrical Engineering student at NIT Silchar with a growing interest in programming, web development, and problem-solving. I enjoy working on projects that blend logic with creativityâ€”whether it's coding in Python, designing a clean website interface, or collaborating on technical events.

Outside of academics, I like staying involved in campus activities and continuously exploring new areas in tech. My goal is to keep building my skills through hands-on learning and contribute meaningfully to wherever I work.</i></p>
